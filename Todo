Next Release
============

- Remove the message from should, add shouldOrMessage?
  - Is it possible to have argument with default value?
    
- Add more checking options?
  - assert
  - deny
  - failIf
  - shouldEqual
  - shouldNotEqual
    - Its easier to crate nice error message for equal, showing the 
      arguments, instead of having to write the message manually.

- Support multiple test script using text format (.applescript). 
  Currently only .scpt files are supported, which do not play well
  with version control.
