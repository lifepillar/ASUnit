ASUnit is testing framework for AppleScript, influenced by SUnit, ASTest
and Python [unittest][unittest] module.

[unittest]: http://docs.python.org/lib/module-unittest.html "unittest"

Features:

* Easy to install, no dependencies, minimal boilerplate code.
* Automatic and manual test case registration.
* Runs in *AppleScript Editor*, displays results in a new document.
* Aggregates multiple test scripts.

This text is mostly a shameless copy of Kent Beck's [SmallTalk testing framework][SmallTalk], modified for ASUnit.

## Installation

To use ASUnit, unzip and copy the file `ASUnit.scpt` to the Scripts folder, either in
your Library folder, or in the global Library folder in the startup disk.

To use in a script, your test script should inherit from ASUnit. In the example, ASUnit
was installed in the global Library folder (local domain):

    property parent : load script file ((path to scripts folder from local domain as string) & "ASUnit.scpt")


## Cookbook

Here is a simple pattern system for writing tests. The patterns are:

<table>
	<tr><td>Fixture</td><td>create a common test fixture</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Test Case</td><td>create the stimulus for a test case</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Check</td><td>check the response for a test case</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Test Suite</td><td>aggregate Test Cases</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Test Runner</td><td>run a test suite and display results</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Test Loader</td><td>aggregate test scripts</td></tr>
</table>

### Fixture

A fixture is a certain configuration of the system, required to test a certain feature.
A complete test for a community of objects will have many fixtures, each of which will
be tested in many ways. 

#### Design a test fixture

1. Create fixture script, inheriting from TestCase.
2. Add properties for each known object in the fixture.
3. Override `setUp()` to initialize the properties.

AppleScript lacks introspection, so registering of fixtures is done by using factory
methods during compile time. Instead of inheriting from `TestCase` directly, call
`registerFixture()`, which registers the fixture and makes your script inherit
from `TestCase`.

In the example, the test fixture is two lists, one empty and one with elements.
First create a script object, then add properties for the objects we need to reference
later:

    script |accessing list|
        property parent : registerFixture(me)
        
        property empty : missing value
        property notEmpty : missing value

Then override `setUp()` to create the objects for the fixture::

    on setUp()
        set empty to {}
        set notEmpty to {"foo", 1}
    end


### Test Case

You have a Fixture, what do you do next?

#### How do you represent a single unit of testing?

Each test of the fixture is represented by a script object in the fixture.
Test scripts uses the fixture `setUp()` and `tearDown()` handlers to make sure
different tests do not interfere with each other.

#### Represent a predictable reaction of a fixture as a script object

1. Add a script object inheriting from the fixture.
2. Stimulate the fixture in the *test* method.

Again, you don't inherit directly from the fixture, but call `registerTestCase()`,
which registers the test case and makes it inherit from the current fixture.

We can predict that adding "bar" to an empty list will result in "bar" being in the
list. Add a script object to the fixture, and stimulate the fixture in its run handler:

    script |add item|
        property parent : registerTestCase(me)
        set end of empty to "bar"
        ...
    end
    
Once you have stimulated the fixture, you need to add a Check to make sure your
prediction came true.


### Check

A Test Case stimulates a Fixture.

#### How do you test for expected results?

If you're testing interactively, you check for expected results directly in the results
or event log pane. You want a way to programmatically look for problems. One way to
accomplish this is to use the standard error handling mechanism with testing logic to
signal errors:

    if empty does not contain "bar" then error "where is bar?!"
    
When you're testing, you'd like to distinguish between errors you are checking for,
like getting six as the sum of two and three, and errors you didn't anticipate, like
subscripts being out of bounds or messages not being understood.

When a catastrophic error occurs, the framework stops running the test case, records
the error, and runs the next test case. Since each test case has its own fixture, the
error in the previous case will not affect the next.

The testing framework makes checking for expected values simple by providing a method,
should, that takes an expression as first argument, and an error message as second
argument. If the expression evaluates to true, everything is fine. Otherwise, the test
case stops running, the failure is recorded with the error message, and the next test
case runs.

#### Check by calling *should* with an expression

In the example, after stimulating the fixture by adding "bar" to an empty list,
we want to check and make sure it's in there:

    script |add item|
        property parent : registerTestCase(me)
        set end of empty to "bar"
        should(empty contains "bar", "no bar?!")
    end

There is a variant on `should()`. `shouldnt()` causes the test case to fail if the
expression argument evaluates to true. It is there so you don't have to use "not
(...)".    

Once you have a test case, you can run it. Send `test()` to the script object:

    |accessing list|'s |add item|'s test()
    
If it runs to completion, the test worked. If you get an error, something went wrong. The result of sending `test()` to a `TestCase` is a `TestResult` object.


### Test Suite

You have several Test Cases.

#### How do you run lots of tests?

Soon you will have many test cases, and fixtures. You could just string together a
bunch of expressions to run test cases. However, when you then wanted to run "this 
bunch of cases and that bunch of cases" you'd be stuck.

The testing framework provides an object to represent "a bunch of tests", `TestSuite`.
A `TestSuite` runs a collection of test cases and reports their results all at once.
`TestSuite`s can also contain other `TestSuite`s, so you can put Joe's tests and
Tammy's tests together by creating a higher level suite.

#### Combine test cases into a test suite

Tests are automatically collected in each script file. To make this happen, you must 
create a property named `suite` and initialize it with a `TestSuite` in each ASUnit 
test script. As usual, you use a factory function for that.

Add this code at the start of your test script using a descriptive name for the test 
suite:

    property suite : makeTestSuite("Test Suite Name")
    
To run all the tests in the the current file, tell suite to test:

    set results to suite's test()
    
The result of sending `test()` to a `TestSuite` is a `TestResult` object. It records 
all the test cases including their failures or errors, and the time at which the suite 
was run.


### Test Runner

Running a `TestSuite` and inspecting the `TestResult` returned is not very convenient. 
You would like to click one button to run a suite of tests. The framework supplies a 
`TextTestRunner`, which runs a `TestSuite` and displays progress and test results.

To run the suite in a test script, create a `TextTestRunner` and tell it to run:

    run makeTextTestRunner(suite)

Now when you click the *Run* button in *AppleScript Editor*, the test will run and you
will get a test report in a new *AppleScript Editor* document.


### Test Loader

Soon you will have more than one test script. It is too much work to open each and run 
the tests each time. The framework supplies a `TestLoader`, which searches for tests 
scripts in folders, and returns a suite with all the tests. The `TestLoader` looks for 
file names that start with *Test* and ends with *.scpt*, like *Test Module.scpt*, in 
the folder you specify.

To collect and run all the test scripts in the current directory, create this script:

    property currentFolder : folder of file (document 1's path as POSIX file) of application "Finder"
    property parent : load script file ((path to scripts folder from local domain as string) & "ASUnit.scpt")
    set suite to makeTestLoader()'s loadTestsFromFolder(currentFolder)    
    run makeTextTestRunner(suite)

Now you may open a single script and click the *Run* button to run all your test
scripts.


### Example Test Script

Here is an example test script you can use as a template for your scripts::

    property parent : load script file ((path to scripts folder from local domain as string) & "ASUnit.scpt")
    property suite : makeTestSuite("My Tests")
        
    script |accessing list|
        property parent : registerFixture(me)
        property empty : missing value
        property notEmpty : missing value
        
        on setUp()
            set empty to {}
            set notEmpty to {"foo", 1}
        end setUp
        
        script |add item|
            property parent : registerTestCase(me)
            set end of empty to "bar"
            should(empty contains "bar", "no bar?!")
        end script
        
        script |add same item|
            property parent : registerTestCase(me)
            set end of notEmpty to "foo"
            should(last item of notEmpty is "foo", "first foo vanished?!")
            should(first item of notEmpty is "foo", "where is last foo?!")
        end script
    end script
    
    run makeTextTestRunner(suite)


## Customizing the Framework

### Creating your own TestCase class

It is common to have helper handlers needed by multiple fixtures. It is also possible 
to change the behavior of `TestCase` to adapt to special needs. To create your own 
`TestCase`, create a script inheriting from `TestCase`, and let the concrete fixture inherit from it. To create a fixture, use `makeFixture()`. To register a fixture that 
inherits from a custom class, use `registerFixtureOfKind()`:

    script |user defined TestCase|
        property parent : makeFixture()
    end
    
    script |concrete fixture|
        property parent: registerFixtureOfKind(me, |user defined TestCase|)
        
        script |test case|
            property parent : registerTestCase(me)
            -- add test code here
        end
    end 


### Creating your own TestSuite class

It is rarely need to customize `TestSuite`. If you want to change the way test results 
are collected, create your own `TestResult` class. If you want to do new operations on 
a `TestSuite`, create a new visitor class inheriting from `Visitor`. However if you do 
need to create your own `TestSuite`, you can create a script inheriting from 
`TestSuite`, and set the suite property to your own `TestSuite`:

    script MyTestSuite
        property parent : makeTestSuite(my name)
    end
    property suite : MyTestSuite


### Creating your own TestResult class

To change the testing policy or the way results are collected, you can define your own 
TestResult class inheriting from `TestResult`:

    script MyTestResult
        property parent : makeTestResult("Test name")
    end

To run a test case or suite with your own `TestResult`, call `runTest()` on the 
`TestResult` object with the test case or suite as argument:

    MyTestResult runTest(aSuite)

To use a `TextTestRunner` with your own `TestResult`, call `setTestResult()`
before running:

    set runner to makeTextTestRunner(suite)
    runner's setTestResult(MyTestResult)
    run runner


### Creating new operations on a test suite

If you want to add a new feature to a test suite, create a visitor that implement the 
new feature. Here is an example of HTML formatter that formats a list of the test in 
the suite:

    script HTMLFormatter
        property parent : Visitor
        property html : missing value
        
        on format(aTest)
            set html to {}
            set end of html to "<ol>" & return
            aTest's accept(me)
            set end of html to "</ol>" & return
            return html as string
        end
        
        on visitTestCase(aTestCase)
             set end of html to "<li>" & aTestCase's fullName() & "</li>" & return 
        end
        
    end

To get a list of test cases use:

    HTMLFormatter's format(suite)


### Creating your own TestRunner

You can create whatever runner you like, there is no special API your runner must 
implement. However if you want to be notified about running suites and tests, and about 
single test cases results, you should set your runner as observer of the `TestResult`. 
See the source of `TextTestRunner` for example.
